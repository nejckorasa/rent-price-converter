What is it
-------

Ever looked for apartments to rent and had problems converting between **PW** (per week) and **PCM** (per calendar month) rent prices? 

Maybe it's just me... Anyway, here's a Python script to help you with conversion.

Use responsibly.

Conversion Function
-------

```
rent_pw * 52 / 12 = rent_pcm

# For example
150 pw * 52 / 12 = 650 pcm
```

Usage
-------

```
> ./rent_price_coverter.py 1300 pcm
300 pw
```

```
> ./rent_price_coverter.py 150 pw
650 pcm
```
